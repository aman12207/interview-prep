An Api (Application Programming Interface) is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.

Endpoint/Path?query1&query2 or Endpoint?query1&query2

Endpoint :- every API that interacts with a external system, like a server, will have an endpoint.

Parameters :- In order to allow the API to be flexible enough to deal with custom queries, usually APIs allow us to provide parameters. And parameters go at the end of the URL, after a question mark.And then there's a key value pair that goes into the URL.The key is called ‘contains’ and then after an equal sign is the query.The first query follows a question mark, and every subsequent query follows an ampersand, or an and symbol.

What is REST?
Rest is short for Representational State Transfer. It's an architectural style for designing APISs.
